I participated in a contest to design better merging patterns for the New Jersey Turnpike. As the team leader, I found that cellular automata models could effectively solve the problem and made changes to the theoretical model. The issue was complicated because I soon realized that the best solution in theory is not always the best solution in practice, because the latter is often the most cost-effective. Therefore, instead I considered the length of various types of cars, local driving policies, and collected a great deal of data on both traffic flow and average vehicle speeds during rush hour and off-peak hours. Given the cost of real-world funding, I abandoned the best theoretical model and opted to minimize changes to the original configuration. Employing my strong programming skills, I quickly constructed eight sub-models that gathered the collected data for simulation. I then used the k-means method of analysis to obtain the final solution.
